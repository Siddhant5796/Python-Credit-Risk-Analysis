# Python Credit Risk Analysis


Credit risks are a result of the clients that could hurt your business by not being able to pay. 

A credit risk can result from:
- a small account with poor credit and the potential to go out of business
- a large account with high concentration that could make your business insolvent
The ultimate goal is to determine the creditworthiness of borrowers by quantifying the risk of loss that the lender is exposed to

In the current analysis, I predicted the creditworthiness of loan borrowers 93% accurately by quantifying the risk of loss that the lender might be exposed to using K-nearest neighbors and linear regression methods in Python. I identified accuracy, precision, and recall as the performance indicators to identify the defaulters.
